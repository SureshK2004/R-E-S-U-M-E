"Good morning, sir. I’m Santhosh Raj, and I recently completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Applications from Agurchand Manmull Jain College, Chennai. I graduated with a GPA of 8.05, which reflects my dedication and commitment to my studies. During my time at college, I developed a strong foundation in various programming languages and frameworks, particularly in Python, which has become my primary focus.
Throughout my academic journey, I actively sought opportunities to apply my theoretical knowledge in practical settings. One of the most significant experiences I had was my internship at Shiash Info Solutions, where I worked as a Python Full-Stack Developer for three months. This role provided me with invaluable hands-on experience in developing web applications. I primarily used Python along with Django for the backend, and MySQL for database management. One of the key projects I worked on involved creating a predictive model for aluminum manufacturing. This project not only enhanced my technical skills but also taught me the importance of understanding user requirements and translating them into effective solutions.
In addition to my technical skills, I have a strong interest in problem-solving. I enjoy tackling challenges and finding innovative solutions, which I believe is essential in the field of software development. I’m always eager to learn and adapt to new technologies, and I believe that a strong analytical mindset is crucial for success in this industry.
Moreover, I possess leadership qualities and teamwork skills, which I demonstrated by organizing an inter-college tech fest called BIT-SYNC. This event attracted over 450 participants and included various technical activities. My role involved coordinating with different teams, managing logistics, and ensuring that everything ran smoothly. This experience not only honed my organizational and communication skills but also reinforced my belief in the power of collaboration.
I’m excited about the opportunity to work as a Python Developer and contribute to a team that values innovation and collaboration. I’m particularly drawn to [Company Name] because of its commitment to [specific aspect of the company, such as innovation, technology, or community impact]. I believe that my technical background, coupled with my passion for problem-solving and teamwork, makes me a strong fit for this role. Thank you for the opportunity to introduce myself, and I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to your team."
